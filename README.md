# Password_Encryption
This is my 1st Semester Minor Project, that was aimed to teach us about the mechanism and concept of "encryption" of sensitive data/information like passwords,etc. 
The Project was made on the concept of "Affine Cipher".

*Update*
While Learning Python, I built another personal project on the mechanism and concept of "Encryption". 
This time the Project uses the concept of "Caesar Cipher".
